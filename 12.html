<p align = "center"> <font size = "100"> Welcome to our mini garden with swing! We have a guava tree here and it fruits so many and I don't want it because
of its odor. My family loves guava but I hate it. Anyway, sometimes late at night when I feel like thinking, I will just sit or lay at the swing
and watch the nightsky. I am always a lover of the nightsky, stars and the moon, I just love it. </p>
