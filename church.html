<p align = "center"> <font face = "times new roman" size = "4.5" > I am a born again Christian and belonged to our Dance Ministry there. Since I was 6 years old,
I am already dancing in our church, serving the Lord. In the years that I am in the ministry, of course I have grown in faith and also my frienships, too.

<p align = "center"> Now, by the grace of the Lord, I am handling a group with 9 girls in it. I am really blessed to be their leader in the ministry.
After being a member for years, now's the time for me to stand up and to guide the new generation of God's servants. It's not easy handling a team because of each other's
differences including our age gap but fortunately, we get along so well! Photoshoot is also our main kind of bonding so as the outcome, we have a lot of good
pictures together! Here are some:

<p> I also met my bestfriend in the church. I am really so blessed to have her in my life. Maybe, even her, doesn't know how much I am grateful
to God that I met her and I lover her so much. We have things in common and we also share differences but still, we fit so perfectly.
Sometimes, we are just amazed how we click. We shared a lot of tears and laughs together. We already know each other even the smallest details.
She is really someone whom I can confidently tell my secrets with because I know it is safe kept. We also have a lot of events in the church
that we attended together. We are both dancers in the church.
