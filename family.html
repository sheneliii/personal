<p> <font color = "black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my family. I am the eldest child. I am supposedly the only child because my parents thought
I am enough. But when I was around 11 years old, I requested for a brother and there! I already have brothers.

I'm grateful that I got to have siblings because they are now bringing joy to our home. They are my super active brothers. One is 7 years old and the other is 3 years of old. 
My little brother serves as my stress reliever because of his too much cuteness and fluffiness! But the other one serves as my stress (Just kidding) I love
them so much, of course.

These are my loving parents.My father is a head cook in Chowking and my mother is a housewife. I cannot ask for more because for me, they are the
best parents in the world. Their love for me is unconditional and they understand every situation I'm in. And I love how I can open up
to them and how they are there for me when I need someone to lean on. Though they are not perfect, I know it, but so am I. I have to accept their flaws
as a parent but it's nothing compare to the things they have done for me. I am looking forward to that one day that I will be able to make them
really proud as I will receive my diploma on stage as I graduate college. I will prove to them that each of their sacrifices for me
is worth it. No words can express how I love them. <br/>

We are a born-again Christian family, attending church on Church Of God- Dasmarinas.
 I am a dancer in our church and my parents are sunday school teachers. I can't say that I have a perfect family because there is no one here on earth has. 
But I can say that the Lord is gracious for our family for keeping us bonded and complete.  

I can say that we are a bonded family. I can open up to my mom and dad about anything I want to share. We also have this character in us that
we are not shy to express our love to our relatives by means of physical touch. Whenever I meet my loved ones, I kiss/mano them to show respect and love
for them. I am also not shy to say "I love you" to my parents because why not, I truly love them with all my heart. <br/> <br/>

The left photo shows my family on my mother's side and on the other hand, is my dad's side. We are really close to one another. Every Christmas, we celebrate it
with my mom's side and when it's New Year, it's the other way around. I am really thankful to God for His gift of family. Truly that the family is one of my treasure in this life.
