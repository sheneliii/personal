<p align = "center"> <font face = "times new roman" size = "4.5" > College is really tough but if you have true friends, they will make
your everyday bearable! Even if there's a lot of stuffs to do, college friends are there to suffer with you! :D
This is also the time when you will that you are not a kid anymore and you already have a lot of responsibilities to take care of.
The time when your health is not a priority just to meet the deadlines of your professors. Also, college will define your future.
BUT, if you have friends, IT WILL ALL BE WORTH IT AND YOU COLLEGE LIFE WILL BE A MEMORABLE ONE.

<p align = "center"> We are 5 in our main squad as of the moment but we are also close to our other classmates. We have a friend who migrated
to Australia last semester and we missed her so much. My squad is not perfect, we are REALLY different from one another. We do not
have a lot of things in common but we bond goodly! Despite of our differences, we meet each other half-way to understand
each other. We share our secrets about our own lives because we know we can trust one another. I hope we are still solid when time flies!
