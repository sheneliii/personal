<p align = "center"> <font face = "times new roman" size = "4.5" > They say that highschool moments are something that last longer in your memories because
it includes a lot of firsts and stupidity as a teenager. And of course, highschool is composed of the best people in life! People
who was there for you in your ups and downs, whom you shared your tears and laughs with.
 </p>
<p align = "center"> My main group is composed of 9 person including myself. We are solid that time. And I admit that I miss the times when we are able
to be with each other everyday. Now that we have our own college lives, it's hard to stay updated with them but of course the memories remain
</p>

<p> I remember the times when our whole class will sing along and have jamming. One of our classmates will bring a guitar and that's it! It's enough
for us to have a jamming session each morning! I also remember everytime we sneak out to the canteen just because we are bored in class and also when we eat
lunch together is what I am missing the most because it is when intimate talks happen and also gossips! :D One of the best about highschool
is you happy crushes, exactly! I remember when I have a crush on someone for the whole 4 years of highschool because he's just too
handsome in my eyes and he's not into girls just like anybody else. His too far for my reach, and for that I called him "pangarap" :D </p>

I also experienced my first heartbreak during highschool. I experienced being a "rebound" but now, I just laugh about it because
it brings memories of my foolishness! I enjoyed a lot of extra curricular activities back then that I don't experience anymore in college
like campings and contests. And oh how I love campings!!!! I love spending outdoor activities with friends and acquantances and the fact
that I can watch the nightsky as I sleep at tents. And also the camp fire, yes!!! I remember that time when we created cheer and yell for our presentation
that night and everything is fun! Oh it's so good to reminisce the good things in the past.... </p>

<p> Another moment that I am very nostalgic is, is our PROMENADE. It is very memorable for me because it is night full of dancing and fun. Moments that I cherish and carry
along as I grow up and a story that I will tell to my children and grandchildren. A night when I got the chance to dance with the significant
people in my life.
